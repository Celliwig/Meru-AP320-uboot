# Meru-AP320-uboot
U-Boot for the Meru Networks AP320.

## WARNING!!!
This has been produced by examining the configuration of the device while the original U-boot was running, not by reversing the binary image.
The upshot of this is that all configuration has been for my device, and any variation in the chipsets (DRAM/PHY/etc) will not have been taken
in to account. So whether this will work on any other device is hard to say (YMMV). So the usual boilerplate applies, no warraties implied or given.
